        <h4> Future in University </h4>
        <p>
            For now, while I am still in University, I plan on improving my programming skills.
            Also, as I am already interested in gaming so much, I plan on becoming a game developer or
            a game designer at some point. For this, I am going to take up subjects that deal with game 
            design and game development.

        <p> 
            As I plan on having a career in game design or game development, I have looked up a few job oppurtunities 
            that are related to this. They are: 
        </p>
        <ul> 
            <li> Games Designer </li>
            <li> Game Programmer </li>
            <li> Games Animator </li>
            <li> Games Artist </li>
            <li> Game Play Tester </li>
        </ul>

        <h5> Games Designer </h5>
        <p>
            For a new game that is being created, a proposal is drafted by a team of game designers who address 
            important details like the target audience, budgets, deadlines and the scope of the game. Video game 
            designers make the concept and the layout of the game come alive and they experiment with different 
            genres and themes. They check the theme or genre that suits the game and they give it a go for the 
            actual development phase. This proffesion is very interetsing to me as I have always wanted to give 
            my own design input for the development of a game.
        </p>
        

        <h5> Games Programmer </h5>
        <p>
            A Games programmer is a software engineer who develops game developement tools using programming skills. 
            They basically develop the code bases for the video games so that the video games can run in real time. 
            As programming and gaming are hobbies of mine, this would be a perfect job oppurtunity for me.
        </p>

        <h5> Games Animator </h5>
        <p>
            A games animator is a multimedia artist who specializes in video games. Game animators combine art and technology
            to create interactive animated environments for games. Game animators come into the design aspect of video games. 
            They do not develop the code for the video game themselves (the game programmer does this) but they design the core
            functionalities of games. This job oppurtunity is very interesting to me as game design is a very fun aspect of 
            creating video games.
        </p>

        <h5> Games Artist </h5>
        <p>
            As a game animator creates the core functionalties of the game using visual platforms, a game artist creates the 2D and 3D
            art for the visual elements of a video game. They create various elements of a game like characters, vehicles, props, scenery, 
            background, objects, colors, textures and clothing. All these elements give the game animator an idea of what to create using the 
            visual tools. As this job oppurtunity directly relates to the design aspect of video games, I would explore it more and see if 
            it is the right job for me.
        </p>

        <h5> Game Play Tester </h5>
        <p>
            A Game Play Tester is a qualtiy assurance tester that plays video games that are under development to check for glitches and bugs 
            in the game. Normally, game play testing takes place incremently as different phases of the game are developed. It happens with the
            design phase and the development phase together. As playing video games is a hobby of mine, this would be a perfect job oppurtunity 
            for me.
