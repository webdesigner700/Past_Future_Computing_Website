        <h4> Childhood computing experience </h4>
        <p>  
            Since childhood, I have always loved video games.My parents bought me an xbox 360 
            when I was in my 7th grade and I started playing the kinect games on it. The techology
            used for the kinect motion sensor was really intriguing. After this, I was hooked on to gaming and computing.
            I wanted to learn how the hardware of a console works and I also started to pick up an interest in making games.
        </p>
        <p> 
            When I was in my 8th grade I started to take computing subjects in my school and I 
            really liked them. I took subjects which taught me the basics of computing hardware,
            software and the operating system. I also learnt a bit of HTML when I was in my 10th grade.
        </p>
        <h4> High School computing expereience </h4>
        <p>
            When I was finally in the 11th grade I took a java programming subject as an elective. I had my doubts
            whether it was the right programming language for me to learn. But after learning how the obect oriented programming
            works and how java's core funtionality completely depends on it, I was hooked onto learning java. For the course of my 
            11th and 12th grade, I continued to master the basic concepts of java programming.
        </p>

        <h4> My University break computing experience </h4>
        <p> 
            For the 6 month break that I had to take between my high school and University,
            I leant how to do python programming. My father had suggested to me that python is a booming
            language that is very user friendly in terms of syntaxes and complexity. So, I
            took a course on python programming on the website coursera. I managed to learn the bascis very 
            easily as I had the experince of learning java and I also leant some web elements in python programming.
