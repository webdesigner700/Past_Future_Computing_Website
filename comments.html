    <h4> Short refletion on overall design </h4>
    <p>
        For the overall website, it is mostly a white dominated background along with blue main headings for each webpage. 
        All of the sub-headings in each webpage has a red color scheme to have a constrasting effect with the main heading 
        of each webpage. Also, all the descriptions in each webpage have their own font-style and their own background color
        to differentiate it from the rest of the webpage. For the hobbies in the "Past" webpage, a list is used to display the
        hobbies. Also, the hobbies section has a black background along with pictures of the hobbies.
    </p>
    <h4> Technical Aspects of website </h4>
    <p>
        The Index.html page of the website gives an introduction of me and gives the links to the other parts of the website 
        using a table.
        The Past.html page gives some information about my computing experience in childhood, university and the webpage also 
        talks about my hobbies.
        The Future.html page talks about my future in the university and also talks about some job oppurtunities that I want to 
        pursue in the future. 
        My website incorporates a total of 6 ID selectors and 9 class selectors. The website uses a total of 9 divisions in total 
        (9 div tags) and one use of the span tag to style inline content.
        The following class selectors are used:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li> index.websiteintro 
            <p>
            The class selector "websiteintro" is used to style an inline text using the span tag. As it is in the first paragraph of 
            the "Index" webpage, the class selector emphasises the name of the person (me) who created the website.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li> past.links1 
            <p>
            The class selector "links1" is used to style the links given on the "Past" webpage. It aligns the links to the center of 
            the page and gives the text in the links a different font and color.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li> past.pastcomp 
            <p>
            The class selector "pastcomp" gives the computing experience description given in the "Past" webpage some style. It gives the 
            description a different background color and font to section it off from the rest of the webpage.  
            </p>
        </li>
        <li> past.hobbies 
            <p>
            The class selector "hobbies" gives the Hobbies section in the "Past" webpage its own style. It gives the section a black background
            and a white text color. 
            </p>
        </li>
        <li> future.links2 
            <p>
            The class selector "links2" is used to style the links given on the "Future" webpage. It aligns the links to the center of the page 
            and gives the text in the links a different font and color.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li> future.jobs 
            <p>
            The class selector "jobs" styles the "Different Job Oppurtunities" section in the "Future" webpage. It gives the section a blue 
            background and gives the text a new font and color.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li> future.jobdescriptions 
            <p>
            The class selector "job descriptions" gives the job descriptions in the "Future" webpage its own background color and font-style. 
            This helps the descriptions to be sectioned off from the other parts of the website and this essentially helps the reader
            understand the webpage easily.
            </p>
        </li>
        </ul>
    <p>
        The following ID selectors are used: 
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li> index.tableheading 
            <p>
            The ID selector "tableheding" gives the subheading "Links to all other webpages" in the "Index" webpage its own color and alignment. 
            This is because I wanted to align this subheading with the main heading of the webpage giving the entire webpage a consistent look. 
            </p>
        </li>
        <li> index.linksdescription 
            <p>
            The ID selector "linksdescription" gives the third row of the table in the "index" webpage a black background and a whit text color.
            This is because I wanted the description of the links to be highlited so that the user notices it and reads the description.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li> past.linkheading1 and future.linkheading2
            <p>
            The ID selectors "linkheading1" and "linkheading2" gives the sub-heading "Links:" a center alignment, a different font and a 
            blue color so that it matches the main heading of the webpage.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li> past.hobbyheading 
            <p>
            The ID selector "hoobyheading" gives the sub-heading "Hobbies in Computng" a center alignment and a new text color. As this 
            sub-heading is in a different section with a black background, I wanted it to differ from the rest of the subheadings in the webpage.
            </p>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h4> Asthetics </h4>
    <p>
        For the "Index" webpage, I used a blue main heading and a short introduction of myself below it. In the introduction, there is some 
        italic text which says "Sai Vinay Bayyapunedi and this webiste is about me." This is because I wanted the readers to notice that text 
        and let them know that the website is about me. For the links and the description for each link, I used a table. For the row in the 
        table that gives the link descriptions, I put the background color as black so that the readers would easily notice it and read it. 
        Also, the black row makes the entie webpage look more appealing to me.
    </p>    
    <p>
        For the "Past" webpage, I used a blue main heading and I put the links to the other webpages below it. I seperated the links from the 
        rest of the webpage by adding a horizontal line break above and below the links so that the reader would find the webpage more 
        minimalistic and simple. Below the links, my past computing experience is explained in three subparts and this section of the three
        subparts has a cream colored background along with different font. I did this because I thought the reader would find the text more 
        appealing to read due to the different background color and font. After this section, the hobbies are sectioned off into a black 
        backgrounded part of the webpage. The text is white in color and along with the pictures of the hobbies, I felt the reader would 
        immediately be interested in reading the hobbies section as this section has very high color contrasting.
    </p>
    <p>
        For the "Future" webpage, the "different job oppurtunities" section has a blue background along with a list of my favourite jobs. 
        As the sub-heading is red, I put the background color of this section as blue to have a constrasting appearence and also used square
        bullet points so that the section would look morev appealing to read. The job descriptions below this section has a cream colored 
        background with different font sectioning it off from the other parts of the webpage. The attributes used for the styling here is 
        the same as the attributes used for the "past computing experience" description in the "Past" webpage. I thought this gave the entire
        website a very consistent look.
    </p>

    <h4> Accessibility</h4>
    <p>
        To make the website more accessible to users, I added descriptions of what each link does in the "Index" webpage in clear italic text.
        Also, for the images in the Hobbies section, I added alternative text to them so that the reader would understand what the images 
        represent in case the images won't load.
